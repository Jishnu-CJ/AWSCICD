Hey folks,

These files are used in this project, where we automate the generation of an image using CodePipeline.

I've divided this project into five steps:

1. Setting up CodeCommit (Private Code Repository).
2. Creating a project in CodeBuild.
3. Setting up CodePipeline.
4. Test the application. 
5. Cleanup

I've discussed, the cost element in the end, which is almost zero under free-tier (except for ECS).

You can follow this post to have a walkthrough of this demo.
